LearnSphere is an innovative web-based platform designed to revolutionize learning within local communities, developed in response to the hackathon's Community Improvement Track challenge. This project uses the power of Python and Flask to create an educational experience.

At the heart of LearnSphere is an AI chatbot, that guides users through complex topics, making learning both accessible and engaging. The chatbot's interface allows for personalized interactions, offering explanations, answering queries, and providing feedback specific to each user's learning pace and style.

Complementing the chatbot is a virtual lab. Here, users can experiment with physics concepts by adjusting variables such as object mass and observing the effects in real-time simulations. The chatbot also has knowledge of the lab and can assist users in doing the lab, and explain why certain things happen.

LearnSphere aims to support education, foster community engagement, and improve public services by making learning more interactive and enjoyable. With its focus on user customization and interactive learning, LearnSphere Interactive promises to be a valuable resource for students and educators.
