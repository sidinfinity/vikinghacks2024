This is due to the constant effect of gravity. The deceleration due to             Answer: 5.6.2
gravity going up is the same as the acceleration due to gravity coming
down. The speed it loses going up is therefore the same as the speed
it gains coming down, as shown in Figure 5.17. So the projectile hits
