LearnSphere is an innovative web-based platform designed to revolutionize learning within local communities, developed in response to the hackathon's Community Improvement Track challenge. This project leverages the power of Python and Flask to create an immersive educational experience tailored to enhance understanding of physics, specifically focusing on the principles of projectile motion and orbital motion.

At the heart of LearnSphere is a sophisticated AI chatbot, meticulously crafted to guide users through complex topics, making learning both accessible and engaging. The chatbot's intuitive interface allows for personalized interactions, offering explanations, answering queries, and providing feedback tailored to each user's learning pace and style.

Complementing the chatbot is a virtual lab, a feature that sets LearnSphere apart. Here, users can experiment with physics concepts by adjusting variables such as object mass and observing the effects in real-time simulations. This hands-on approach not only reinforces theoretical knowledge but also encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

LearnSphere aims to support education, foster community engagement, and improve public services by making learning more interactive and enjoyable. With its focus on user customization and interactive learning, LearnSphere Interactive promises to be a valuable resource for students, educators, and anyone keen on exploring the fascinating world of physics.
